# Rust Implementation Plan for Signal Registration Service

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to rewrite the Signal Registration Service in Rust, focusing on LDAP authentication while maintaining Twilio verification and Signal Server integration.

## Timeline Estimate: 7-10 Days

### Days 1-2: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
- Project initialization with Cargo
- Core dependencies setup:
  - Tonic (gRPC)
  - ldap3-rs (LDAP client)
  - tokio (async runtime)
  - config (configuration management)
- LDAP Integration:
  - Connection pooling
  - Authentication logic
  - Phone number extraction
  - Error handling
- Basic logging and monitoring setup

### Days 3-4: Twilio Integration
- SMS verification implementation
- Voice verification implementation
- Verification code handling
- Rate limiting implementation:
  - Session creation limits
  - SMS verification limits
  - Voice verification limits
  - Code check limits
- Twilio API client with proper error handling
- Metrics and monitoring

### Days 5-6: Core Services
- Session management:
  - Session creation
  - Session storage
  - Session expiration
- gRPC service implementation:
  - Proto file compilation
  - Service endpoints
  - Request/response handling
- Captcha integration
- Signal Server integration:
  - Registration flow
  - Error handling
  - Response mapping

### Days 7-8: Testing Suite
- Unit tests:
  - LDAP authentication
  - Twilio integration
  - Session management
  - Rate limiting
- Integration tests:
  - End-to-end registration flow
  - Error scenarios
  - Rate limiting behavior
- Load testing:
  - Concurrent session handling
  - Rate limiter behavior
  - Connection pool performance

### Days 9-10: Finalization
- Documentation:
  - API documentation
  - Deployment guide
  - Configuration guide
- Security review:
  - Credential handling
  - Session security
  - Rate limiting effectiveness
- Performance optimization:
  - Connection pooling
  - Async handling
  - Resource utilization
- Deployment configuration:
  - Docker setup
  - Environment configuration
  - Monitoring setup

## Key Components

### Authentication Flow
1. LDAP authentication to verify credentials
2. Phone number extraction from LDAP record
3. Twilio verification (SMS/Voice) to ensure device possession
4. Captcha verification for anti-automation
5. Signal Server registration integration

### Security Considerations
- Secure credential handling
- Rate limiting across all endpoints
- Session security and expiration
- Proper error handling and logging
- Secure configuration management

### Performance Requirements
- Efficient connection pooling
- Proper async handling
- Resource-conscious implementation
- Monitoring and metrics

## Notes
- All timeframes are estimates and may need adjustment based on specific requirements or challenges encountered
- Security and performance testing should be ongoing throughout development
- Documentation should be maintained as features are implemented
